# What was developed

This project simulates a zoo report system. The system contains information about the animals in the zoo, employees, operating hours, and a price table that varies according to the visitors' ages.

The system includes a set of functions capable of retrieving various information about the zoo and its operation, using JavaScript concepts.

## Technologies

> JavaScript | Jest | npm | VS Code. 

## Skills Developed

- __Applied Test Driven Development (TDD)__ principles.
  
- Wrote tests using **Jest** to validate the functionality of the project's functions.

- Enhanced my use of variables in JavaScript, distinguishing when to use **let** and **const**.
  
- Used __arrow functions__ to create functions in a more concise and readable manner.
  
- Applied __template literals__ to build strings more efficiently and clearly, allowing the inclusion of expressions.
  
- Practiced using the __spread operator__ to copy and combine arrays and objects.

- Utilized the __rest parameter__ to handle an indefinite number of arguments in functions.
  
- Implemented __object destructuring__ to extract values directly from objects.
  
- Used __array destructuring__ to access elements directly from arrays in a simpler way.
  
- Applied __default destructuring__ to set default values when destructuring objects and arrays.
  
- Practiced __abbreviated object__ literal syntax when creating objects whose properties have the same names as the variables.
  
- Used __default parameters__ to define default values in functions, ensuring predictable behavior when values are not provided.
  
- Worked with __higher-order functions__ to manipulate and transform arrays functionally.
